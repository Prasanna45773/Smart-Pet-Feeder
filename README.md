# Smart-Pet-Feeder
The Smart Pet Feeder automatically dispenses food for your pet on command. It monitors food levels in the storage container and feeding bowl with ultrasonic sensors and updates the Blynk app in real time. Owners can remotely control the servo-driven dispenser and receive alerts when the food supply is low or the bowl is empty.
